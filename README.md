# PoppingBalloons
A game for any age kids to pop balloons and see surprise objects coming out of it

I created this PoppingBalloons app project to learn and experiment with SpriteKit in swift.

Its a very simple app, which floats random colourful balloons and popping them shows animated surprises, updates scores and at the end of certain scores shows game over
